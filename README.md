# david-bb-site
a clear & concise site only using css and html, including animations. It is served by nginx running on an Ubuntu droplet. I manage the name service on Digital Ocean and the subdomain using nginx. Its ssl cert is from the EFF.

The Goal of this project is to build a website as a sort of digital presence and document what I think it is to have a digital presence because I think it can mean many different things.
