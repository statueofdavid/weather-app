# Weather-App
a clear & concise site only using css, html, and js. It is served by nginx running on an Ubuntu droplet. I manage the name service on Digital Ocean and the subdomain using nginx. Its ssl cert is from the EFF.

The Goal of this project is to build a website that delivers weather and tide info based on the device's location.
## Go -> https://weather.declared.space
