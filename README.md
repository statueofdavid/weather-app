# weather-app
well started using the weather APIs and tide info for my kid's crew practice and well I feel like it is making my personal site a bit cluttered. Then I realized that the data was very static when I went up for a day trip to the mountains and I couldn't get weather info from my site. Lame... anyway running out of room so yeah.
